# Jets-Project

The Jets project is a simple program designed to list and show a aircraft and their pilots. 
Both the aircraft and pilots have a class of their own along with a constructor which allows arrays to 
be used within the program. The display manager holds the guts of the program and allows you to list specific 
information. Additionally there is a small file that allows you to take one of the planes "out for a spin". 
The flight file would have worked better but I was unable to figure out how to make the escape commands work
within the terminal.
